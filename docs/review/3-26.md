## Basic Data Structures in Python

Python provides several built-in data structures that can be categorized into mutable and immutable types:

- Mutable data structures: list, dict, set, bytearray
- Immutable data structures: int, float, str, tuple, frozenset, bytes

Mutable structures can be modified after creation (e.g., appending to a list).

Immutable structures cannot be changed after creation (e.g., strings).

## HTTP Request Methods in the `requests` Library

The requests library in Python supports various HTTP methods for interacting with web services:
- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server (e.g., requests.get(url)).
- **POST**: Send data to the server, often used for form submissions or API calls (e.g., requests.post(url, data)).
- **PUT**: Update an existing resource (e.g., requests.put(url, data)).
- **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server (e.g., requests.delete(url)).
- **PATCH**: Partially update a resource (e.g., requests.patch(url, data)).
- **HEAD**: Similar to GET but only retrieves headers (e.g., requests.head(url)).

## Upload Files with `requests`

The `requests` library makes it easy to upload files using a POST request. Here's a basic example:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://example.com/upload'
files = {'file': open('test.txt', 'rb')}
response = requests.post(url, files=files)

print(response.status_code)
```
**Explanation:**

- `files={'file': open('example.txt', 'rb')}` creates a multipart-encoded file upload.
- The key (`file`) should match the backend API's expected form key.
- Ensure you handle potential errors with `try-except` or `response.raise_for_status()`.

## Basic Structure of a `Pandas` DataFrame
A pandas DataFrame is a two-dimensional, labeled data structure with columns of potentially different types — similar to a table or a spreadsheet.

**Basic components:**
- Rows (index): The horizontal axis representing individual data entries.
- Columns: The vertical axis representing specific attributes or features.
- Data: The core content stored in cells.

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'], 'Age': [25, 30, 35]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

## Basic Data Structures in `Pandas`

pandas has tow primary structures
- Series(1D): A Series is a one-dimensional labeled array.
    ```python
    import pandas as pd

    s = pd.Series([10, 20, 30], index=["a", "b", "c"])
    print(s)
    ```

- Dataframe(2D): A DataFrame is a two-dimensional table, similar to a spreadsheet.
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    
    data = {"Name": ["Alice", "Bob"], "Age": [25, 30]}
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    print(df)
    ```

- Index Object: Both Series and DataFrame have an Index to manage row labels.
    ```python
    print(df.index)  # RangeIndex(start=0, stop=2, step=1)
    print(df.columns)  # Index(['Name', 'Age'], dtype='object') 
    ```

## Basic Methods in pandas
Some essential pandas methods include:

- **head() / tail()**: View the first/last few rows (df.head(5))
- **info()**: Display DataFrame structure (df.info())
- **describe()**: Get statistics of numeric columns (df.describe())
- **sort_values()**: Sort DataFrame by column (df.sort_values(by='Age'))
- **groupby()**: Group data based on columns (df.groupby('Category').sum())
- **isnull() / fillna()**: Detect or fill missing values (df.fillna(0))


## Difference Between loc and iloc Methods
- **loc:** Label-based selection — selects rows/columns by their labels (e.g., df.loc[1, 'Name']).
- **iloc**: Integer position-based selection — selects rows/columns by their numeric indices (e.g., df.iloc[1, 0]).

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob'], 'Age': [25, 30]})
print(df.loc[0, 'Name'])   # Alice
print(df.iloc[0, 0])        # Alice
```

## Basic Usage and Components of Langchain Framework
Langchain is a powerful framework for building applications using language models (LLMs). It supports tasks like chatbots, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and AI agents.

**Core components include:**
- **Prompt templates**: Structure the input prompts efficiently.
- **Chains**: Link multiple LLM calls or actions together.
- **Agents**: Allow the model to decide which tools or APIs to call.
- **Memory**: Maintain conversation context between user interactions.


## Basic Usage of PyTorch Framework
PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library focused on deep learning.

**Key steps:**

1. **Define a model**: Create a neural network using nn.Module.
2. **Define a loss function**: Common choices include MSE, CrossEntropy, etc.
3. **Choose an optimizer**: Examples include SGD, Adam, etc.
4. **Train the model**: Loop over the dataset, compute loss, and update weights.

## Modify the Most Recent Git Commit
If you want to modify the latest commit without creating a new one:

1. Amend the commit message:
    ```bash
    git commit --amend
    ```

2. Add new changes to the last commit:
    ```bash
    git add <file>
    git commit --amend
    ```
   
3. Force push if you've already pushed the old commit:
    ```bash
    git push origin branch-name --force
    ```
if you want to delete most recently commit

1. This keeps your file modifications staged.
    ```bash
    git reset --soft HEAD~1
    ```

2. This removes the commit and all changes.
    ```bash
    git reset --hard HEAD~1
    ```

`git rm --cached` does not delete a commit — it only removes the file from the staging area while keeping it in your working directory.
